  ↓
Agent: "Reading source (8,500 lines)...
Analyzing content for extractable items..."
```

### Stage 2: Analyze & Categorize
```
Agent: "Analysis complete.

Found 12 core concepts:
  - useState (state management)
  - useEffect (side effects)
  - useContext (context consumption)
  ... (9 more)

Found 8 common errors:
  - Hooks called conditionally
  - Hooks in loops
  - Hooks outside components
  ... (5 more)

Found 3 workflows:

## Error Workflow (Interactive)

### Stage 1: Search Existing
```
/context error for "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
  ↓
Agent: "Searching existing errors for similar issues...

Found 1 similar error:
   development/errors/react-errors.md (Line 45)
     ## Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
     Covers: General undefined property access in React
     Frequency: common

Found 2 related errors:
   development/errors/react-errors.md
     ## Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
     ## Error: Undefined is not an object"
```

### Stage 2: Check Duplication (APPROVAL REQUIRED)
```
Agent: "Options:
  [A] Add as new error to react-errors.md
      (Specific case: 'map' on undefined array)

  [B] Update existing 'Cannot read property X' error
      (Add 'map' as common example)

  [C] Skip (already covered sufficiently)

Which framework/category?
  [1] React (react-errors.md)
  [2] JavaScript (js-errors.md)
  [3] General (common-errors.md)
  [4] Create new: ___

Select option + category (e.g., 'B 1'):"

User: "B 1"
```

### Stage 3: Preview (APPROVAL REQUIRED)
```
Agent: "Would update development/errors/react-errors.md:

Current (Line 45):

## Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined

**Symptom**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
```

**Cause**: Attempting to access property on undefined/null object.

**Solution**:
1. Add null check before accessing property
2. Use optional chaining (?.)
3. Provide default value

**Code**:
```jsx
//  Before
const value = obj.property

//  After
const value = obj?.property ?? 'default'
```

**Prevention**: Always validate data exists before accessing
**Frequency**: common
**Reference**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_access_property


Proposed update:

## Error: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined

**Symptom**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'X' of undefined
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined  ← NEW
TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined  ← NEW
```

**Cause**: Attempting to access property on undefined/null object.
Common with array methods (map, filter) when data hasn't loaded.  ← NEW

**Solution**:
1. Add null check before accessing property
2. Use optional chaining (?.)
3. Provide default value (especially for arrays)  ← UPDATED

**Code**:
```jsx
//  Before
const value = obj.property
const items = data.map(item => item.name)  ← NEW

//  After
const value = obj?.property ?? 'default'
const items = (data || []).map(item => item.name)  ← NEW
// Or with optional chaining:
const items = data?.map(item => item.name) ?? []  ← NEW
```

**Prevention**: Always validate data exists before accessing.
For arrays, provide empty array default.  ← UPDATED

**Frequency**: common
**Reference**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_access_property

Approve? (yes/no/edit):"

User: "yes"

### Stage 4-6: Add, Update, Report
```
Agent: "Updating development/errors/react-errors.md...

 Updated error in development/errors/react-errors.md
 Cross-referenced with 2 related errors
 File size: 105 lines (under 150 limit)

Changes:
  - Added 'map' and 'length' to symptom examples
  - Updated cause to mention array methods
  - Added array-specific code examples
  - Updated prevention guidance"

## Common Patterns

### Approval Gates
All operations with `enforce="@critical_rules.approval_gate"` MUST:
1. Show clear preview of what will happen
2. Wait for explicit user input
3. Provide options (yes/no/edit/preview/dry-run)
4. Never proceed without confirmation

### Conflict Resolution
When conflicts detected:
1. Present all options clearly
2. Use letter-based selection (A/B/C)
3. Show impact of each option
4. Allow user to choose resolution

### Previews
All previews should show:
1. What will be created/modified/deleted
2. File sizes (before → after)
3. Line-by-line diffs for updates
4. Validation status (under limits, no broken links)

### Backups
Operations that modify files MUST:
1. Create backup before changes
2. Store in `.tmp/backup/{operation}-{topic}-{timestamp}/`
3. Report backup location
4. Keep backups for rollback
